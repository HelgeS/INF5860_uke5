# INF5860_uke5_solutions

In this exercies you will try to build some very specific neural networks "by hand" and try some normalization.
I hope it will build some intuition on how neural networks and "Non-linearities" work.

The exercies is solved by writing code in **hand_trained_neural_networks.py** and **distorted_cifar**.
In hand_trained_neural_networks your are not supposed to alter the function *neural_net_from_parameters*.

In **hand_trained_neural_networks.py** you may need to change the number of weight-matrices sendt to the function
neural_net_from_parameters.

To check if a solution is correct you can run (may take some time)

    nosetests
    
To check a tests in a single file run e.g.:

    nosetests test_hand_trained_neural_networks.py

To run a single_test:

    nosetests test_hand_trained_neural_networks.py:test_grayscale_shift

Solutions can be found on github:

   git clone https://github.com/sigmunjr/INF5860_uke5_solutions.git

Good luck!
